# Issue Refunds

You can issue refunds to your customers using the Dashboard or APIs. Refunds are possible for `captured` payments only.

**INFO**

**Customer Looking for Refund**

If you are a customer looking for a refund, know about [customer refunds](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/customers/customer-refunds.md).

## Full and Partial Refunds

Refunds can be made either in **full** or in **part**.

- **Full Refund**

You can refund the entire amount that you received in the payment.

- **Partial Refund**

You can refund part of the amount received in the payment. You can issue multiple, partial refunds as long as their sum does not exceed the captured amount.

A payment moves to the `refunded` state only when the entire amount is refunded to the customer. In case of partial refunds, the payment remains in the `captured` state till the entire payment is refunded.

To issue refunds:
