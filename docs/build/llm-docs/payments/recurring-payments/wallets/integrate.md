# Integrate Recurring Payments Using Wallets

Set up recurring payments using Touch'n Go wallet. Customers authorise their wallet once and subsequent payments are processed automatically without additional authentication.

## Integration Flow

The recurring payments integration involves three main steps:

1. [Register Wallet Mandate](#1-register-wallet-mandate): Customer authorises their wallet for future charges.
2. [Fetch Token Details](#2-fetch-token-details): Retrieve and verify the mandate registration.
3. [Charge Customers](#3-charge-customers): Create subsequent payments as needed.

## 1. Register Wallet Mandate

Mandate registration creates an **authorisation transaction** where customers provide consent to charge their Touch'n Go wallet for future payments. This generates a secure **token** that represents the customer's payment authorisation.

    

        
**WARN**

**Watch Out!**

Standard Checkout authorisation can only be created using Razorpay Curlec APIs.

        **Step 1:** [**Create a Customer**](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/payments/recurring-payments/wallets/create-authorization-transaction.md#111-create-a-customer)
        
        Create a customer record in Razorpay Curlec to associate the mandate with. This returns a `customer_id` to be used in subsequent steps.

        **Step 2:** [**Create an Order**](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/payments/recurring-payments/wallets/create-authorization-transaction.md#112-create-an-order)
        
        Create an order for the authorisation amount. You can set this to RM 1 for minimal authorisation or the actual first payment amount. Pass the token parameters including `max_amount` and `expire_at` to set mandate limits.

        **Step 3:** [**Create Authorisation Payment**](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/payments/recurring-payments/wallets/create-authorization-transaction.md#113-create-an-authorization-payment)
        
        Initialise Razorpay Curlec Checkout with the `order_id`, `customer_id` and recurring-specific parameters. Specify `wallet` as the payment method. The customer completes the authorisation on Touch'n Go interface. Once the authorisation is successful, you receive a `token_id` in the payment response. This token represents the customer's wallet mandate.

    
    

        ### Registration Link Flow

        

        **Create a Registration Link** using:
        - [APIs](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/payments/recurring-payments/wallets/create-authorization-transaction.md#121-create-a-registration-link)
        - [Dashboard](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/recurring-payments/create.md#1-create-a-registration-link)

        Specify the authorisation amount, customer details, wallet type (Touch'n Go) and token parameters (max_amount and expire_at). The link can be sent to your customer via email or SMS.

        **Send the link** to your customer. The customer clicks the link, is redirected to Touch'n Go wallet interface, and completes the authorisation.

        
**INFO**

**No Need to Create Customer and Order Separately**

When using registration links, Razorpay Curlec automatically creates both the customer and order records for you.

        ### Registration Link Statuses

        A registration link moves through the following states during its life cycle:

Status | Description | Webhook
---
Issued | A registration Link is created and sent to the customer. | NA
---
Paid | Payment is made for the issued registration Link.
Once the registration Link is paid, search for Token corresponding to the payment. | [invoice.paid](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/payments/recurring-payments/webhooks.md#invoice-paid)
---
Cancelled | The registration link has been canceled. In such cases, you need to create a registration link again.| NA
---
Expired | The registration link has expired. You can set an expiry timestamp at the time of creation. | [invoice.expired](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/payments/recurring-payments/webhooks.md#invoice-expired)

    

    
### Authorisation Payment Statuses

         Once the customer has made the Authorisation Payment, it moves through the following states as per the [payment flow](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-gateway/how-it-works.md):

Status | Description | Webhook
---
Created | Payment is created when a customer enters and submits the payment information. | NA
---
Authorized | Payment is authorized when the customer’s payment details are successfully authenticated by the bank. | [payment.authorized](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/payments/recurring-payments/webhooks.md#payment-authorized)
---
Captured | Indicates that the payment is verified by you.
Once a payment is captured you can [retrieve the token](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/recurring-payments/create.md#3-search-for-the-token). | [payment.captured](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/payments/recurring-payments/webhooks.md#payment-captured) or [order.paid](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/payments/recurring-payments/webhooks.md#order-paid)
---
Failed | Indicates that the payment has failed.
If the payment has failed, you need to [create an authorisation transaction](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/payments/recurring-payments/cards/create-authorization-transaction.md) again. | [payment.failed](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/payments/recurring-payments/webhooks.md#payment-failed)

        

## 2. Fetch Token Details

After the authorisation transaction is complete, a **token** is generated. The token securely stores the customer's wallet authorisation and represents their mandate.

You can retrieve token information using:

- [APIs](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/payments/recurring-payments/wallets/tokens.md)
- [Dashboard](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/recurring-payments/create.md#3-search-for-the-token)
- [Webhooks](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/recurring-payments/subscribe-to-webhooks.md#token-states)

    
### Token Lifecycle

         Tokens move through different states from creation to expiry:

         

         

`token_status` | Description | Next Step
---
`initiated` | Indicates that the bank is processing the mandate registration. | Wait for the [token.confirmed](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/payments/recurring-payments/webhooks.md#token-confirmed) webhook.
---
`confirmed` | Indicates that the bank has completed the mandate registration. | [Create recurring payment](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/recurring-payments/create.md)
---
`rejected` | Indicates that the mandate registration has failed. | Create the authorisation transaction again.
---
`cancelled` | Indicates that the token has been cancelled. | Create the authorisation transaction again if you want to charge the customer.
---
`paused` | Indicates that the token has been paused by your customer. | The token is inactive. Your customer has paused the token. Ask them to resume the token to charge them.

        

## 3. Charge Customers

Once the token is in **confirmed** state, you can create recurring payments without customer intervention. Each subsequent payment requires you to create a new charge request.

**WARN**

**Important**

- Always ensure the charge amount does not exceed the `max_amount` specified during token creation. Charges exceeding this limit will fail.
- Ensure customers maintain sufficient balance in their Touch'n Go wallet for successful recurring charges.

### How to Charge Customers

    

        **Step 1:** [**Find the Token**](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/recurring-payments/create.md#3-search-for-the-token)
        
        Use the Dashboard search to locate the customer's token. Verify the token status is **confirmed**.

        **Step 2:** [**Create a Charge**](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/recurring-payments/create.md#4-charge-the-token)
        
        Click **Charge Token** and enter the payment amount. Razorpay Curlec automatically creates an order and processes the payment.

        
**INFO**

**Automatic Order Creation**

When charging via Dashboard, Razorpay Curlec automatically creates the order for you - no need to create it separately.

    
    
        
        **Step 1:** [**Create an Order**](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/payments/recurring-payments/wallets/create-subsequent-payments.md#31-create-an-order-to-charge-the-customer)
        
        Each subsequent payment must be associated with a unique order. This allows you to track payments and handle retries. Specify the charge amount, currency (MYR) and optional notes for tracking.

        **Step 2:** [**Create a Recurring Payment**](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/payments/recurring-payments/wallets/create-subsequent-payments.md#32-create-a-recurring-payment)
        
        Use the `token_id` to create a payment for the order. No customer action required. The payment is processed automatically against the customer's Touch'n Go wallet balance.

        
**SUCCESS**

**Best Practice**

Set up webhooks to receive real-time notifications about payment status changes. This ensures you are immediately notified of successful or failed charges.
