# About EMI

EMI provides an option to your customers for making total payment in easy equal monthly installments at the applicable interest rates from the list of banks and partners. This payment option encourages your customer to make big value purchases without worrying about paying the full amount upfront. Customers pay principal amount and interest in monthly equal installments.

With Razorpay, you can offer your customers EMI as a payment method to buy various products on EMI using   Debit Cards, Credit Cards, No Cost EMI, Low Cost EMI and Cardless EMI. 

**WARN**

**Watch Out!**

Instant Refunds are not supported on EMI, Cardless EMI and Pay Later.
