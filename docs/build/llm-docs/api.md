# API Reference Guide

Razorpay APIs are completely RESTful, and all our responses are returned in JSON.

**INFO**

**Integrations**

- Looking to integrate your website, ecommerce store or mobile app with Razorpay Payment Gateway? Find the [right integration method](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-gateway.md#integration-types).
- Accept payments [**without** a website or app](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments.md#accept-payments) using other Razorpay products, such as Payment Links, Payment Pages, Subscription Links, Invoices and Smart Collect.
- For S2S integration, contact the [Support team](https://razorpay.com/support/#request) with your requirements.

  

   Our APIs are present on the Razorpay [Postman Public Workspace](https://www.postman.com/razorpaydev/workspace/razorpay-public-workspace/collection/12492020-952c7295-118c-400f-8f2c-5266ef6f689a). Watch the video to know how to fork APIs and save them to your private workspace for testing.

   All Razorpay APIs are authenticated using Basic Authentication. You must [generate test API keys](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/authentication.md) on the Dashboard before trying the APIs.
   

## API Gateway URL

For most of the Razorpay APIs, the Gateway URL is `https://api.razorpay.com/v1`. You need to include this before each API endpoint to make API calls. However, certain APIs are on V2. Hence, the gateway URL may differ for certain APIs.

    
### Example

            

            - Use the URL `https://api.razorpay.com/v1/payments` to access payment resources.

            - Use the URL `https://api.razorpay.com/v2/accounts` to access Route (Linked Account)-related resources.
